# 290. Word Pattern
# DIFFICULTY: EASY
class Solution(object):
    def wordPattern(self, pattern, s):
        """
        :type pattern: str
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # ðŸ’¡ Approach:
        # 1. Split the string `s` into individual words using split().
        # 2. If the number of pattern characters and words are not equal, return False.
        # 3. Use two hash maps (dictionaries):
        #       - char_to_word â†’ to map pattern characters to words.
        #       - word_to_char â†’ to map words back to pattern characters.
        # 4. Traverse both pattern and words together using zip():
        #       - If a character is already mapped to a different word â†’ return False.
        #       - If a word is already mapped to a different character â†’ return False.
        #       - Otherwise, store the new mapping in both dictionaries.
        # 5. After checking all pairs, return True (pattern follows the word mapping correctly).
