        # ðŸ’¡ Approach:
        # This solution uses a **stack-based approach** to find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
        # 1. Initialize a stack with -1 to handle base indices for valid substrings.
        # 2. Iterate through the string using index `i` and character `ch`:
        #    - If `ch` is '(', push its index onto the stack.
        #    - If `ch` is ')':
        #        - Pop one element from the stack (matching '(' if exists).
        #        - If the stack becomes empty, push the current index `i` as a new base for upcoming substrings.
        #        - Otherwise, calculate the valid length as `i - stack[-1]` and update `max_len`.
        # 3. Return `max_len` as the final result.
        # This approach ensures every valid pair is tracked and invalid boundaries are marked for future reference.
        # Time Complexity: O(n) â€” single pass through the string.
        # Space Complexity: O(n) â€” due to stack usage.
