📚 DSA Daily Tracker

This repository documents my daily practice of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems.
Solutions are organized by topic for clean navigation, consistent learning, and strong interview preparation.

- Solutions are organized by topic folders, such as:
  - Arrays/
  - Strings/
  - LinkedList/
  - Stacks/
  - Queues/
  - Trees/
  - Graphs/
  - DynamicProgramming/

Each folder contains solution files clearly named after the problem solved.

🎯 Goal

Practice DSA daily

Strengthen algorithmic thinking

Build interview-ready skills for top tech companies
