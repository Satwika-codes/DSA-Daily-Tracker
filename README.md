# DSA-Daily-Tracker
This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.  Organized by topic, it helps me build strong problem-solving skills consistently, tracking progress day by day..
Repository Structure

- Solutions are organized by topic folders, such as:
  - Arrays/
  - Strings/
  - LinkedList/
  - Stacks/
  - Queues/
  - Trees/
  - Graphs/
  - DynamicProgramming/

Each folder contains solution files named clearly according to the problem solved.

## Goal

Consistently solve and push DSA problems to build a strong foundation for coding interviews.
## How to Use

- Browse folders to find solutions by topic.
- Feel free to explore the code and learn different approaches.
